As can be seen from the name, perspective transformation is a process used when you want to change the point of view of an object in a picture. In perspective transformation, we can change the perspective of a particular image or video to get a better understanding of the content. In this study, perspective transformation will be used to accurately and completely transfer the content of the image to digital media. If it is not used, there is an incorrect transfer of information in subsequent processes.</h3>
